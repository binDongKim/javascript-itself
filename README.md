### TypedArray, ArrayBuffer and view

>__TypedArray__ consists of buffer(ArrayBuffer) + view.  
>__Arraybuffer__ is an actual strorage for the bytes which is used for binary data transfers between server and client.  
>You need __View__ to access the content of __Arraybuffer__.

### for...in vs for...of

>__for...in__ only iterates __enumerable__ properties including prototype chain.  
>__for...of__ only works with iterable objects such as Array, String.

***

### Array.from vs Spread Syntax

>__Array.from__ can be used with Array-like objects or iterable objects.  
>__Spread syntax(...)__ (other than in the case of spread properties) can be only used with iterable objects.

***

## Temporal Dead Zone with let, const

>In ECMAScript 2015, __let__ bindings are not subject to __Variable Hoisting__, which means that __let__ declarations do not move to the top of the current execution context. Referencing the variable in the block before the initialization results in a __ReferenceError__ (contrary to a variable declared with var, which will just have the undefined value). The variable is in a __"temporal dead zone"__ from the start of the block until the initialization is processed.

***

## Functions

>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are __Function__ objects.

***

## Rest parameters

>function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {}  
If the last named argument of a function is prefixed with ..., it becomes an __array__ whose elements from 0 (inclusive) to theArgs.length (exclusive) are supplied by the actual arguments passed to the function.

***

## Rest parameters(...) vs Spread syntax

>__Rest syntax__ is the opposite of __Spread syntax__: __Spread__ 'expands' an array into its elements, while __Rest__ collects multiple elements and 'condenses' them into a single element.

***

## "this" in ES6 Arrow functions

>The __this__ value (internally) is not actually bound to the arrow function. Normal functions in JavaScript bind their own __this__ value, however the __this__ value used in arrow functions is actually fetched lexically from the scope it sits inside. It has no __this__, so when you use this youâ€™re talking to the outer scope.
