### TypedArray, ArrayBuffer and View

>__TypedArray__ consists of buffer(ArrayBuffer) + view.  
>__Arraybuffer__ is an actual strorage for the bytes which is used for binary data transfers between server and client.  
>You need __View__ to access the content of __Arraybuffer__.

***

### for...in vs for...of

>__for...in__ only iterates __enumerable__ properties including prototype chain.  
>__for...of__ only works with iterable objects such as Array, String.

***

### Array.from vs Spread Syntax

>__Array.from__ can be used with iterable objects or Array-like objects which don't implement the iterable protocol.  
>__Spread syntax(...)__ (other than in the case of spread properties) can be only used with iterable objects.

***

## Temporal Dead Zone with let, const

>In ECMAScript 2015, __let__ bindings are not subject to __Variable Hoisting__, which means that __let__ declarations do not move to the top of the current execution context. Referencing the variable in the block before the initialization results in a __ReferenceError__ (contrary to a variable declared with var, which will just have the undefined value). The variable is in a __"temporal dead zone"__ from the start of the block until the initialization is processed.

***

## Functions

>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are __Function__ objects.

***

## Rest parameters

>function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {}  
If the last named argument of a function is prefixed with ..., it becomes an __array__ whose elements from 0 (inclusive) to theArgs.length (exclusive) are supplied by the actual arguments passed to the function.

***

## Rest parameters(...) vs Spread syntax

>__Rest syntax__ is the opposite of __Spread syntax__: __Spread__ 'expands' an array into its elements, while __Rest__ collects multiple elements and 'condenses' them into a single element.

***

## "this" in ES6 Arrow functions

>The __this__ value (internally) is not actually bound to the arrow function. Normal functions in JavaScript bind their own __this__ value, however the __this__ value used in arrow functions is actually fetched lexically from the scope it sits inside. It has no __this__, so when you use this youâ€™re talking to the outer scope.

***

## Iterable in Javascript

>An object is iterable if it defines its iteration behavior, such as what values are looped over in a for...of construct. Some built-in types, such as Array or Map, have a default iteration behavior, while other types (such as Object) do not.  
In order to be __iterable__, an object must implement the __@@iterator__ method, meaning that the object (or one of the objects up its prototype chain) must have a property with a __Symbol.iterator__ key.

***

## Prototype Chaining

>What happens if you call a method on person1, which is actually defined on Object?
```javascript
person1.valueOf()
```
>The browser initially checks to see if the person1 object has a valueOf() method available on it. It doesn't, so the browser then checks to see if the person1 object's __prototype__ object(Person function/class prototype object) has a valueOf() method available on it. It doesn't either, so the browser then checks to see if the Person function/class prototype object's prototype object(Object prototype object) has a valueOf() method available on it. It does, so it is called.

***

## Property access/use declared with/in function

```javascript
function A() {
  var aVar = function() { console.log("local variable"); };
  this.aVar = function() { console.log("member property"); };
}

A.prototype.aVariable = function() { console.log("prototype property"); };
A.aVar = function() { console.log("static property"); };

var a = new A();
a.aVar(); // log: member property
a.aVariable(); // log: prototype property
A.aVar(); // log: static property

// There is no way to access/use the local variable aVar outside of the function A.
```
***

## Default Parameters

>Default function parameters allow formal parameters to be initialized with __default values__ if no value or undefined is passed.

```javascript
function multiply(a, b = 1) {
  return a * b;
}

multiply(5, 2); // 10
multiply(5);    // 5
```
