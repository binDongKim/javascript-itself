### TypedArray, ArrayBuffer and View

>__TypedArray__ consists of buffer(ArrayBuffer) + view.  
>__Arraybuffer__ is an actual strorage for the bytes which is used for binary data transfers between server and client.  
>You need __View__ to access the content of __Arraybuffer__.

***

### for...in vs for...of

>__for...in__ only iterates __enumerable__ properties including prototype chain.  
>__for...of__ only works with iterable objects such as Array, String.  
__for...of__ will loop over DOM collections like NodeList objects correctly:

```javascript
var list = document.querySelectorAll( 'input[type=checkbox]' );
for (var item of list) {
  item.checked = true;
}
```

***

### Array.from vs Spread Syntax

>__Array.from__ can be used with iterable objects or Array-like objects which don't implement the iterable protocol.  
>__Spread syntax(...)__ (other than in the case of spread properties) can be only used with iterable objects.

***

## Temporal Dead Zone with let, const

>In ECMAScript 2015, __let__ bindings are not subject to __Variable Hoisting__, which means that __let__ declarations do not move to the top of the current execution context. Referencing the variable in the block before the initialization results in a __ReferenceError__ (contrary to a variable declared with var, which will just have the undefined value). The variable is in a __"temporal dead zone"__ from the start of the block until the initialization is processed.

***

## Functions

>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are __Function__ objects.

***

## Rest parameters

>function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {}  
If the last named argument of a function is prefixed with ..., it becomes an __array__ whose elements from 0 (inclusive) to theArgs.length (exclusive) are supplied by the actual arguments passed to the function.

***

## Rest parameters(...) vs Spread syntax

>__Rest syntax__ is the opposite of __Spread syntax__: __Spread__ 'expands' an array into its elements, while __Rest__ collects multiple elements and 'condenses' them into a single element.

***

## "this" in ES6 Arrow functions

>The __"this"__ value (internally) is not actually bound to the arrow function. Normal functions in JavaScript bind their own __"this"__ value, however the __"this"__ value used in arrow functions is actually fetched lexically from the scope it sits inside. It has no __"this"__, so when you use this youâ€™re talking to the outer scope. *MOST IMPORTANTLY*, __"this"__ in arrow functions only sets once, which means it's pretty static and it never changes.

***

## Iterable in Javascript

>An object is iterable if it defines its iteration behavior, such as what values are looped over in a for...of construct. Some built-in types, such as Array or Map, have a default iteration behavior, while other types (such as Object) do not.  
In order to be __iterable__, an object must implement the __@@iterator__ method, meaning that the object (or one of the objects up its prototype chain) must have a property with a __Symbol.iterator__ key.

***

## Prototype Chaining

>What happens if you call a method on person1, which is actually defined on Object?
```javascript
person1.valueOf()
```
>The browser initially checks to see if the person1 object has a valueOf() method available on it. It doesn't, so the browser then checks to see if the person1 object's __prototype__ object(Person function/class prototype object) has a valueOf() method available on it. It doesn't either, so the browser then checks to see if the Person function/class prototype object's prototype object(Object prototype object) has a valueOf() method available on it. It does, so it is called.

***

## Property access/use declared with/in function

```javascript
function A() {
  var aVar = function() { console.log("local variable"); };
  this.aVar = function() { console.log("member property"); };
}

A.prototype.aVariable = function() { console.log("prototype property"); };
A.aVar = function() { console.log("static property"); };

var a = new A();
a.aVar(); // log: member property
a.aVariable(); // log: prototype property
A.aVar(); // log: static property

// There is no way to access/use the local variable aVar outside of the function A.
```
***

## Default Parameters

>Default function parameters allow formal parameters to be initialized with __default values__ if no value or undefined is passed.

```javascript
function multiply(a, b = 1) {
  return a * b;
}

multiply(5, 2); // 10
multiply(5);    // 5
```

***

## "this" in javascript

>__"this"__ is the current execution context of a function. It varies under the below circumstances:
>- function invocation: global object(window object or undefined in strict-mode)
>- method invocation: the object which contains the method
>- constructor invocation: the newly created object
>- indirect invocation(call, apply, bind): the first argument

***

## Destructuring Assignment

>The __destructuring assignment__ syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

```javascript
[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
console.log(a); // 10
console.log(b); // 20
console.log(rest); // [30, 40, 50]
```

```javascript
var a = 1;
var b = 3;

[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a); // 3
console.log(b); // 1
```

>A variable can be assigned a default, in the case that the value unpacked from the object is undefined.

```javascript
var {a = 10, b = 5} = {a: 3};

console.log(a); // 3
console.log(b); // 5
```

>Setting a function parameter's default value

```javascript
function drawES2015Chart({size = 'big', cords = {x: 0, y: 0}, radius = 25} = {}) {
  console.log(size, cords, radius); // big {x: 18, y: 30} 30
}

drawES2015Chart({
  cords: {x: 18, y: 30},
  radius: 30
});
```
***

## Bookmarklet

>Entering "javascript:" in the url bar executes javascript and it enables us to manipulate the current page.

***

## DOMContentLoaded vs load

>__DOMContentLoaded__ awaits only for HTML and scripts to be loaded, which means it's fired when the elements in the document are ready to be accessed by the script. The __load__ event is fired when the page is fully loaded with all dependent resources including images and styles.

***

## "href" attribute in &lt;a&gt;

>This attribute may be omitted(as of HTML5) to create a placeholder link. A placeholder link resembles a traditional hyperlink, but does not lead anywhere.

***

## function*: Generator function

>The __function*__ declaration defines a __generator__ function. __Generators__ are functions which can be exited and later re-entered. Calling a generator function does not execute its body immediately; an __iterator__ object for the function is returned instead. When the iterator's __next()__ method is called, the generator function's body is executed until the first __yield__ expression. The __next()__ method returns an object with a __value__ property containing the yielded value and a __done__ property which indicates whether the generator has yielded its last value as a boolean. Calling the __next()__ method with an argument will resume the generator function execution, replacing the __yield__ statement where execution was paused with the argument from __next()__. A __return__ statement in a generator, when executed, will make the generator __done__. If a value is __returned__, it will be passed back as the __value__. A generator which has returned will not yield any more values.

```javascript
function* idMaker() {
  var index = 0;
  while (index < 3)
    yield index++;
}

var gen = idMaker();

console.log(gen.next().value); // 0
console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
console.log(gen.next().value); // undefined
```

***

## HTML tags vs HTML elements

> HTML __tag__ is just opening or closing entity. &lt;p&gt; is an opening tag and &lt;/p&gt; is a closing tag. HTML __element__ encompasses opening tag, closing tag and content. &lt;p&gt;This is the content&lt;/p&gt;: This complete thing is called a HTML element.

***

## HTML Node object vs HTML Element object

>__Node__ is the generic name for any type of object in DOM hierarchy. __Element__ is one specific type of __Node__. DOM consists of a various type of __nodes__ (text nodes, comment nodes etc). So __nodeList__ is simply an array-like list of __nodes__. HTML5 defines __HTMLCollection__ which is a list of HTML Elements(not any node, only Elements). While it is very similar in interface to __nodeList__, a distinction is now made in that it only contains __Elements__, not any type of __node__.  

***

## parentNode vs parentElement

>In most cases, they are same. The only difference comes when a node's __parentNode__ is not an element. If so, __parentElement__ is null.

```javascript
document.body.parentNode; // the <html> element
document.body.parentElement; // the <html> element

document.documentElement.parentNode; // the document node
document.documentElement.parentElement; // null
```

>Since the <html> element(document.documentElement) doesn't have a parent that is an element, parentElement is null.

***

## About DOM

>__DOM__(Document Object Model) represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

***

## innerText vs textContent

>__textContent__ is the raw textual content inside of the node. __innerText__ is the text which would be presented to the user.

```html
<div id="t">
  <div>lions,tigers</div>
  <div style="visibility:hidden">and bears</div>
</div>
```

>__innerText__: "lions, tigers", __textContent__: "lions, tigers and bears"

***

## The problem of document.write()

>document.write() can be called during the page load, while the browser is parsing the page. Once the page has parsed/loaded, calling this function will also call document.open(), which wipes the page and starts from scratch.

***

## About Window.getComputedStyle() and element's style property

>The returned object of getComputedStyle is the same type as the object returned from the element's style property; however, the two objects have different purposes. The object returned from getComputedStyle is read-only and can be used to inspect the element's style. The element.style object should be used to set styles on a specific element. Plus, as you may assume, getComputedStyle returns the absolute/computed values while element's style property returns the relative values such as percentage.

***

## beforeunload event

>The __beforeunload__ event is fired when the user is about to leave the page. Only if a string is assigned to the returnValue of the __event__ object, a dialog appears asking the user for confirmation. Since Chrome 51.0, the custom text support is removed.

***

## keypress vs keydown

>__keypress__ event is fired only when a key that produces a character value is pressed down. __keydown__ event is fired when a key is pressed down no matter whether it produces a character value or not.

***

## event.target and this

>A handler on a parent element always get the details about where the event actually comes from. The most deeply nested element that caused the event is referred as a __target__ element, accessible as __event.target__.  
Note the differences from *this*(=event.currentTarget)
- event.target is the "target" element that initiated the event. It doesn't change through the bubbling process.
- *this*(event.currentTarget) is the "current" element which the handler is actually handling at that moment.  

>Sidenote: *this* doesn't indicate the the current target in the arrow function syntax.

***

## Event Propagation:Bubbling vs Capturing

>With __bubbling__, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. With __capturing__, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements. We can use __addEventListener(type, listener, useCapture)__ to register event handlers for in either bubbling(default) or capturing mode. To use the capturing, pass the third argument as *true*.

***

## DocumentFragment

>__DocumentFragments__ are DOM Nodes but never part of the main DOM tree. Since they only exist in memory, not part of the main DOM tree, appending children to it does not cause page reflow. The usual use case is to create the document fragment, append elements to the document fragment and then append the document fragment to the DOM tree. In the DOM tree, the document fragment is replaced by all its children.
